When a country develops to a certain extent, it becomes a superpower. The superpowers are economically, politically, culturally and militarily very powerful, with influence all over the world. The only superpower in the world right now is the United States. Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, it could also be called a superpower. But because the Soviet Union eventually lost the Cold War, only the United States remained as a superpower. But the United States also developed little by little, the United States can, other countries can also.
国家发展到一定程度就会成为超级大国。超级大国的经济、政治、文化和军事都非常强大，影响力遍及全世界。目前世界上唯一的超级大国就是美国。苏联还没有解体的时候，也可以称作是超级大国。但是由于苏联最终在冷战中落败，所以仅存美国为超级大国。不过美国也是一点一点发展过来的，美国可以，别的国家也行。
